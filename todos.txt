- zeitfenster checken

1) from which time to which time should the graph show the Event? (open gates to everybody left)
18:30 - 08:30.  Scheduled Doors 19:00 - 07:45
2) do you want to Input the In-Counts in the same way as balad beast or any changes?
Same is perfect
3) the sum of the stages capacity is 3120 but you said the Overall cap is 3040?
* VVIB – 160; VIB B & C – 480, Backstage – 250, VIB – 220, GA – 1,930. Total – 3,040.  For now maybe it works to plot these areas in those 5 breakdowns which bundles a few. Need to confirm with Martin and Marc T breakdowns*
4) I did not see emergency Exit routes in the updated map, should i include any?
I can sketch on a map when behind a laptop but essentially back out main entrance, left and right out blow out gates before medical, behind VIP deck along red route
5) you said "capitalise all words", does the mean "usage" -> "Usage" or "USAGE"
’Usage’ style works please
6) which obstacles should i add to the map, in case you do not use the CAD view?
Current obstacles work well - toilets, med etc.  maybe if we just add the site entry / exit and the emergency exits - blow out gates before medical and just to the rear of the site. Again I can plot this if unclear when at laptop 
7) do you think a short Video call is helpfull before showstart?
Yes probably beneficial as Martin is in control, he has interacted with Soundstorm system but not overly familiar with this. Marc T and I are on ground will be familiar. Kris who may at times need to report has likely never seen the system

Future:
- mapbox
- 3d
